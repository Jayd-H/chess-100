# Chess 100
A small GoDot game that allows you to create a custom army with custom pieces and battle otheres online with IP Address. Port Forwarding is required here with port 28960. 

Many new custom units, assets made by me, based on [this](https://wildlifestudios.itch.io/chess-set-pixel-art) sprite pack. 

Very poorly coded and optimised as I was learning GoDot with this project. Might come back to the idea one day but for now consider it abandoned.
